## Product Overview

### What is Locopilot?

Locopilot is a revolutionary coding assistant that brings the power of large language models directly to your local development environment. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Locopilot runs entirely on your machine, ensuring complete privacy and control over your code and intellectual property.

Built on advanced technologies like LangGraph and LangChain, Locopilot doesn't just generate code—it thinks, plans, and executes complex development tasks like a seasoned developer. From a simple interactive shell, you can delegate entire features, bug fixes, and refactoring tasks while maintaining full oversight and control.

### The Problem We Solve

**Privacy Concerns**: Traditional AI coding assistants send your code to external servers, raising security and IP concerns for enterprise and individual developers.

**Limited Context**: Most assistants lose context quickly, making long coding sessions inefficient and repetitive.

**Passive Assistance**: Current tools only respond to prompts rather than proactively planning and executing multi-step tasks.

**Vendor Lock-in**: Proprietary solutions limit your choice of models and customization options.

### Our Solution

Locopilot addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Complete Local Execution**: Works with Ollama and vLLM backends
- **Intelligent Memory Management**: Automatic context summarization and compression
- **Agentic Workflows**: Multi-step task planning and execution
- **Open Source Flexibility**: Full customization and extensibility

## Technical Deep Dives

### Memory Architecture
Locopilot's memory system uses a sophisticated three-tier approach:

1. **Active Memory**: Recent conversation in full detail
2. **Compressed Memory**: Summarized older context using LLM
3. **Project Memory**: Persistent codebase understanding

This allows for truly infinite context while maintaining fast response times.

### Agent Workflow
The LangGraph-based agent follows a structured workflow:

```
User Input → Parse → Route by Mode → Plan → Execute → Summarize → Output
```

Each step is optimized for the specific task type, ensuring efficient and accurate results.

### Extension System
Locopilot's modular architecture supports:
- **Custom Tools**: Add new file operations and integrations
- **Node Plugins**: Extend the agent workflow
- **Model Adapters**: Support new LLM providers
- **UI Themes**: Customize the terminal experience
